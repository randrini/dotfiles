#### Dotfiles Setup

This is my experimental dotfiles. 

Clone the repository at `~` 

Then run `bash init.sh` 

Followed by `sudo zsh zim_init.sh` 

Open Neovim with `nvim` 

Execute `:PlugInstall` to install plugins 

After that, relog the session using `relog` 

For tmux, press `C-a + I` to install plugins
